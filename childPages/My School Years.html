  <div><nav class="menu"><h4>I started my education when I was 5 years old from Pollard Meadows Elementary School &#127979;. I did kindergarden to grade 6 there until I had to change schools to further my education. I studied at Pollard Meadows because I had just moved &#128747; to Edmonton from Montreal at that time and this school was walking distance from my house &#128146;. Luckily, that is where I met my bestfriend &#128109;of 12 years from! My bestfriend and I would walk to school and back everyday together. In grade 2, I moved houses and came to the southside. I started taking the school bus &#128653; to school, but I wasn't alone. My bestfriend also moved one block away from me on the same day. Did I mention that our moms also became best friends as time went on? Well now you know! We took the bus together and on days when we didn't want to our moms would drop us off &#128663;. As time went by, I finished elementary school. Then I picked T.D. Baker Junior High School to go to for my next school. Of course so did my best friend. We would get dropped off and picked up but the best part of the day was blasting music &#128266; in the car! Junior high went by really fast but I joined many sports teams while it lasted. In grade 7 I was on the junior basketball team &#127936;, badminton team &#127934;, and rugby team &#127945;. In grade 8 I was on the senior basketball team &#127936;, and badminton team &#127934;. In grade 8, I got fourth in cities &#127941; in badminton! Lastly, in grade 9 right before Covid-19, I ended the basketball season. That was the year I also got an award &#127942; for the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in basketball! That was all that was in store for me though. During march of my grade 9 year, Covid-19 &#128567; hit and everything went under lockdown &#128683;. To be very honest those 6 months of no school were the most fun I had for as much as I can remember but I also missed a lot in that time frame. I didn't get to experience a grade 9 graduation &#128557;, I didn't get to go on my AC trip to Calgary with my classmates, and I didn't get to live the last couple of months of junior high until school started to get serious &#128559;. Regardless, I decided to go to Harry Ainlay High School for my remaining years in school which of course my best friend also did. Grade 10 started but I chose to do online &#128241; for all of it. Then grade 11 came, but I still stuck with online first semester and along with that choice I also took a 2 and a half month trip to India. It was a girls trip &#128111; so you know what that means... ONLY me and my mom went!! My dad and brother stayed back since my brother couldn't come because of university. I have never stayed away from my parents for that long and since I'm a daddy's girl &#128106; it was more harder but it was a fun experience! I hadn't met my family back home for 5 years and even though I don't know most of them it still felt nice &#128076; to see where my parents were born and where they grew up as well as the people who they grew up with. I came right before the start of second semester hoping to finally go back in school, but Covid had other plans. The cases were getting higher and higher &#128340; which made my decision to stay online for the second semester which leads to now!! All I can say is hopefully I get to experience one year of normal highschool before I go off to the next step in my life. This was how my schools years went and even though I'm not quite done yet, I am grateful to have had such a wonderful experince these past 12 years of my school years.
