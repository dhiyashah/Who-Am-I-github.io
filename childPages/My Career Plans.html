  <div><nav class="menu"><h4> Well today I will be telling you all my career plan as of right now. Before I give out what I want to do in the near future, let me just clear up that I am still in grade 11 so who knows what will really be happening 5 or 10 years down the road. Okay, lets start! Initially, my plan is to definity go into a university. I have the University of Alberta as a backup but I really want to go to the University of Toronto. I want to go into the Faculty of Business but I haven't thought about what specifically either. I have been trying to grow my interest in computers as that is the most growing career in the industry so along with that I plan to get a dual degree in business and technology. After university just like everyone I hope to get a job and settle down once and for all. That is really all on my mind to be honest because at the end of the day I don't know what's really in fate for me. I like to think I have the next 5 years of my life figured out but I'm just as curios as you regarding what tomorrow will look like forget about 5 years from now :)) </h4></nav></div>
