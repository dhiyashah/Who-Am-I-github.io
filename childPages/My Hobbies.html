    <h3> Throughout my entire life I have participated in many activites and many of those have turned into hobbies. Today I am going to talk about my hobbies and why I love doing what I do so much!!</h3>

      <h4><b> 1. Dancing </b></h4> I have been dancing since I was 4 years old. My parents first put me into classes and I grew up learning kathak for 3 years. At the age of 6 I did my first performance in front of hundreds of people and that's when I fell in love with dancing. It felt so nice to just let loose and get so much love! Year after year I did performances wherever I could! I slowly started learning hip-hop and bollywood fusion! I taught myself many of the dances that I have performed and I felt proud of myself everytime I walked onstage. Up until this day I still dance whenever I can and never miss an oppurtunity to get some steps in!
