    <h3> Throughout my entire life I have participated in many activites and many of those have turned into hobbies. Today I am going to talk about my hobbies and why I love doing what I do so much!!</h3>
    <p>
      <h4><b> 1. Dancing &#128111; </b></h4> I have been dancing since I was 4 years old. My parents first put me into classes and I grew up learning kathak for 3 years. At the age of 6 I did my first performance in front of hundreds of people and that's when I fell in love with dancing. It felt so nice to just let loose and get so much love! Year after year I did performances wherever I could! I slowly started learning hip-hop and bollywood fusion! I taught myself many of the dances that I have performed and I felt proud of myself everytime I walked onstage. Up until this day I still dance whenever I can and never miss an oppurtunity to get some steps in!
      <h4><b> 2. Basketball &#127936; </b></h4> I have played basketball from junior high when I got selected to play for the school team. Since then I played almost everyday be it at school or home. I played for the junior team in grade 7 and senior team for grade 8 and 9. I was one of the two grade 8's on the senior team which gave me a lot of confidence in myself. I played in Grade 9 and whenever I didn't have practice I would play on my net with my brother. Once Covid-19 hit, I played EVERYDAY because I had the time to! I would go out from 4 to 9 or even 10 and just play with my friends. Basketball is a sport which gives me confidence in my abilities.
      <h4><b> 3. Swimming &#127946; </b></h4> Swimming in a hobby I have practiced on for years. I started swimming lessons at the age of 7 and completed all the way to level 1o by the age of 11. After that I couldn't continue at that moment because I was too young to be taking the next level of courses. Even though I couldn't tkae more classes, I always went in for a swim at least once a week. Even right now, I make sure that whenever I go anywhere that could have water near me, I take a swimsuit! I love the water and if you tell me to spend hours in a pool, I would happily do it. Swimming freely helps me let go of anything in my mind. It gives me a childish side to me and I always take my friends with me anytime which makes it more fun!
      <h4><b> 4. Biking &#128692; </b></h4> Biking is a hobby because it not only keeps me active, but I also get to spend time with my friends that way. In the summer, there is never one day I don't go without going on a bike ride with at least one of my friends! Biking is just fun especially when there are downhill areas! When I started learning how to ride a bike I was like 5 and I would have both hands on the bike eyes in the front. Now I can ride without any of my hands which makes me feel so cool. Once I started doing these little tricks I enjoyed it so much more because it gave me a chance to explore and learn new things. Everyday in the summer, I get on the bicycle and try doing something new for the fun of it!
